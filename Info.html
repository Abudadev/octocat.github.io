    <h2>Discoveries</h2>
    <p>Marie Maynard has made one of the most important discoveries like the relationship between high cholesterol and hypertension back in Marie's time they fed rats high cholesterol diet's and observed that their arteries got clogged which led to death because no blood would go to the heart and that caused heart attack.
     Later when she graduated she teamed up with another person called Alfred Mirsky together they both tried to figure out what were the main Nucleic acid bases or building blocks were used in DNA to do that they took DNA from different animals and plants.
     They later found out that the most Nucleic acid base used in DNA was adenine,cytosine,guanine, and at last thymine in DNA. Today in biology students still learn about ACGT.
     Back in day some people used to say that there is a compound where ACGT were all together in one compound but the african-american biochemist proved it wrong. She also researched about sugars, and proteins</p>

     <h2>How it all began</h2>
     <p>Marie Maynard was influenced by her father Ivan c. daly, Ivan c. daly loved science but not only she got influenced by her father she was also a little influenced by a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Microbe-Hunters-Paul-Kruif/dp/0156027771" target="_blank">Microbe Hunters</a> made by Paul de Kruif the book is about the microscopic world where they talk about doctors,bacteriologists,scientists,medical technicians who discovered microbes and made vaccines to counter them.</p>

     <h2>Challenges</h2>

     <p>Marie Maynard has gone through some challenges like racism for being black and gender bias for being a female scientist. Back in Marie's time there weren't that many female scientists so she tried to get more women into science but the more she tried the more she had to go through gender bias.</p>
